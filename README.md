### 1. Blood pressure -> Cholesterol 
Initially we started with blood pressure measurement of patient, and we found out that most patient do not have their blood pressure measurement recored in EHR, and we also noticed that most patient who are diagnosed as Hypertensive Heart disease have their Cholesterol measured, consider Cholesterol is also very related, we switched from Blood pressure measurement -> Cholesterol level measurement.
### 2. Why patient facing
We think it would be valuable for patients to know their Cholesterol level in EHR and get tips to stay healthy.
